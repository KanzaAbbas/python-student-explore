<br>
This project is a Python-based Student Data Explorer tool. It allows users to view student information, filter students based on their average grades, and calculate the overall average grade for the filtered students. The project includes two main files: module.py for defining core functions (data handling, filtering, sorting), and main.py for the user interface and interaction. This tool provides a simple yet efficient way to manage and analyze student data
